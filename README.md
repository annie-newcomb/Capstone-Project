# Capstone Project
### Project from Masterschool that utilizes SQL, Excel, and Tableau. 

For this project, Masterschool provided us with fictional data for a fictional company, Unicorn. To get the most out of this data, I started by asking some relevant questions in SQL(some examples listed in the PDF). 

Then, I joined all the tables(using SQL) and uploaded them to google sheets to identify patterns over time. In my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VY65klZvklUI5H-kv87Le6ALjcBsSHMb9oPsCNp0O1o/edit?usp=sharing), I made a filterable dashboard that identified profitable months, regions, customers, and categories for the year selected. 

After looking at this data through google sheets, I moved to tableau where I focused on some key aspects: highest performing state, lowest performing state, and the largest profit loss between months. The powerpoint shows the major points of this assessment and some key charts. 

I have also provided my overarching tableau dashboard which is filterable for all sections.
